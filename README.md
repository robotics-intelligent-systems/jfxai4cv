# Artificial Intelligence in Computer Vision

DocNetAgent is a Python-based project designed to automate the extraction of key information from documents, particularly invoices. Creating a 3D Graph Neural Network (GNN) in Java involves using libraries and frameworks that support graph-based machine learning and 3D visualization. One such library is JGNN, a fast Graph Neural Network library written in native Java. ADE Framework is a graph construction, manipulation, and processing framework. Java JNA wrapper for Tesseract OCR API. JavaCV uses wrappers from the JavaCPP Presets of commonly used libraries by researchers in the field of computer vision. The Eclipse OMR project is a set of open source C and C++ components. The Open Source Imaging Initiative (OSI) represents a new approach to the development of medical imaging devices. The Eclipse Deeplearning4J (DL4J) ecosystem is a set of projects intended to support all the needs of a JVM based deep learning application. MONAI is a PyTorch-based, open-source framework for deep learning in healthcare imaging. NVIDIA Clara Viz is a platform for visualization of 2D/3D medical imaging data. VIAME is a computer vision application. The Compute Library is a collection of low-level machine learning functions. Kornia is a differentiable computer vision library that provides a rich set of differentiable image processing and geometric vision algorithms. SOD is an embedded, modern cross-platform computer vision and machine learning software library that exposes a set of APIs for deep-learning, advanced media analysis & processing including real-time, multi-class object detection and model training on embedded systems with limited computational resource and IoT devices.
