# Artificial Intelligence in Computer Vision

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to interpret and extract meaningful information from images and videos, similar to how human vision works. It involves developing algorithms and techniques to process visual data and make sense of the visual world. This technology has a wide range of applications across various industries, including healthcare, automotive, retail, agriculture, and more. The Open Source Imaging Initiative (OSI) represents a new approach to the development of medical imaging devices. VIAME is a computer vision application. The Compute Library is a collection of low-level machine learning functions. Kornia is a differentiable computer vision library that provides a rich set of differentiable image processing and geometric vision algorithms. SOD is an embedded, modern cross-platform computer vision and machine learning software library that exposes a set of APIs for deep-learning, advanced media analysis & processing including real-time, multi-class object detection and model training on embedded systems with limited computational resource and IoT devices.
