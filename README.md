# Artificial Intelligence in Computer Vision

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to interpret and extract meaningful information from images and videos, similar to how human vision works. It involves developing algorithms and techniques to process visual data and make sense of the visual world. This technology has a wide range of applications across various industries, including healthcare, automotive, retail, agriculture, and more. The Open Source Imaging Initiative (OSI) represents a new approach to the development of medical imaging devices.
