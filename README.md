# Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging

Ultralytics creates cutting-edge, state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLO models. Open Source Biometrics, Face Recognition. Open-source automatic fingerprint identification system (AFIS). Kryo is a fast and efficient binary object graph serialization framework. ojAlgo is Java code that has to do with mathematics. Apache Flink is an open source stream processing framework. Intelligent java is the ultimate tool to integrate with the latest language models. Neureka trains your neural network using a computation graph recorder. The BRIAR Application Programming Interface (API). NIST Biometric Image Software. Biometric SDK is complete open-source Software Development Kit for face, iris and fingerprint modalities. DocNetAgent is a project designed to automate the extraction of key information from documents. Creating a 3D Graph Neural Network (GNN) involves using libraries and frameworks that support graph-based machine learning and 3D visualization. One such library is JGNN. Java JNA wrapper for Tesseract OCR API. JavaCV uses wrappers from the JavaCPP Presets of commonly used libraries by researchers. Eclipse OMR project is a set of open source C and C++ components. The Open Source Imaging Initiative (OSI) represents a new approach to the development of medical imaging devices. The Eclipse Deeplearning4J (DL4J) ecosystem is a set of projects intended to support all the needs of a JVM based deep learning application. MONAI is a PyTorch-based, open-source framework for deep learning in healthcare imaging. Open-source pipeline to create augmented reality (AR) models from scientific data. NVIDIA Clara Viz is a platform for visualization of 2D/3D medical imaging data. AlignTK is a toolkit designed for batch-oriented alignment of a large number of 2-D images in either 2 or 3-dimensions. Although it has been applied most extensively to electron-microscopy (EM) images of neural tissue, the package can be used with arbitrary grayscale images
