# Artificial Intelligence in Computer Vision

The Open Source Imaging Initiative (OSI) represents a new approach to the development of medical imaging devices. The Eclipse Deeplearning4J (DL4J) ecosystem is a set of projects intended to support all the needs of a JVM based deep learning application. MONAI is a PyTorch-based, open-source framework for deep learning in healthcare imaging. NVIDIA Clara Viz is a platform for visualization of 2D/3D medical imaging data. VIAME is a computer vision application. The Compute Library is a collection of low-level machine learning functions. Kornia is a differentiable computer vision library that provides a rich set of differentiable image processing and geometric vision algorithms. SOD is an embedded, modern cross-platform computer vision and machine learning software library that exposes a set of APIs for deep-learning, advanced media analysis & processing including real-time, multi-class object detection and model training on embedded systems with limited computational resource and IoT devices.
